## Development Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

### Project Structure

### Testing

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain test coverage above 90%
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

Example test:

```typescript
describe('Node', () => {
  it('should emit events to registered handlers', () => {
    // Arrange
    const node = happen.node('test');
    const handler = jest.fn();
    
    // Act
    node.on('test.event', handler);
    node.emit({ type: 'test.event', payload: { data: 'test' } });
    
    // Assert
    expect(handler).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
      expect.objectContaining({
        type: 'test.event',
        payload: { data: 'test' }
      })
    );
  });
});
```

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all code
- Follow the existing code style
- Use meaningful variable names
- Write self-documenting code
- Add comments only when necessary
- Keep functions small and focused

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Documentation

- Update README.md with details of changes to the interface
- Update the docs/ folder with any new functionality
- Write JSDoc comments for all public APIs
- Include examples in documentation

## Release Process

1. Update version in package.json
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create a pull request with these changes
4. After merge, create a GitHub release
5. npm publish will run automatically via GitHub Actions
