            ## Security Alert
            
            Automated security scan has detected vulnerabilities in our dependencies.
            
            ## Action Required
            - Review the npm audit output
            - Update vulnerable dependencies
            - Test thoroughly after updates
            
            ## Next Steps
            1. Run \`npm audit\` locally to see details
            2. Run \`npm audit fix\` to automatically fix issues
            3. For vulnerabilities that can't be auto-fixed, manually update dependencies
            4. Create a PR with the fixes
